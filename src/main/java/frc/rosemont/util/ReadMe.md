# ROSEMONT UTILITIES

## SwerveChassisController.java 
  A premade controller class to calculate movement. The objective is to have a premade controller  
class to be used for future years.  

## SuppliedController.java
  A class that can store Supplier<Double>s that can later be used to retrieve analog values from  
physical controllers. The SuppliedController is used to optimize and store controller values that  
can be hidden from common files, making them more readable and organized.  

## DefaultModuleProfile.java
  Meant to be used as a fixed configuration of the SwerveModules for a given year's chassis.
